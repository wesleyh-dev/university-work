INSTRUCTIONS:

The first step is to compile your nucleus modules and link
them with the queues modules. Then you will use the simulator:

1.  emacsim nucleus
2.  l p1:214
3.  b 214
4.  r
5.  set print elements 0
6.  p okbuf
7.  continue

The second step is to test your nucleus with the test functions in
p1.2.c.  This program will test your semop implementation.  The test 
program will do 4 Ps in one atomic operation.

1.  mv p1.c p1.c.orig;  ln -s p1.2.c p1.c; rm p1.o
2.  recompile your programs
3.  emacsim nucleus
4.  l p1:162
5.  b 162
6.  r 
7.  set print elements 0
8.  p okbuf
9.  continue
