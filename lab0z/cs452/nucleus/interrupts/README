In this phase you will test the clock and device interrupts.
The output of the test program will go to the file printer0.
Please note that your output may not be in the same order
as printer0.  The processes will get interrupted at different
locations depending on your nucleus implementation.  Also
the process that prints cpu and system time will show different
times.  But if you sort and diff your printer0 and printer0.demo, 
you should notice minimal differences.
